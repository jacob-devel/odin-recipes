        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Arroz congrí, or Cuban black beans and rice, is a simple but delicious Cuban staple made with rice, black beans, peppers, onions, and garlic.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup dried black beans</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 small onion, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
                <li>1 small green pepper, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
                <li>5 or 6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>Freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh oregano, roughly chopped</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon dried dill</li>
                <li>2 small bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dry red wine, or vino seco</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups long-grain rice, rinsed</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the beans and pick them over for any small stones. Put the beans and 8 cups water in a medium-size pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer, partly cover and cook until tender, about 1 to 2 hours. (Time will vary depending on the bean.)</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the sofrito: Put the oil in a medium-size pot (large enough to hold the rice as well) over medium heat. When it's hot, add the onion, green pepper and garlic. Add a pinch of salt and several grinds of pepper. Sauté until the vegetables are limp. Stir in the oregano, dill and bay leaves and remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Drain the beans, reserving the broth and being careful to not break the beans. In a large measuring cup, add the vinegar and wine, 1 cup of the reserved bean broth and enough water for all the liquid to measure 2 1/4 cups.</li>
                <li>Put the sofrito back on medium heat, add the rice and stir to combine. Cook the rice for 1 to 2 minutes, then add the seasoned bean broth/water mixture and the salt. Bring to a boil, stir, then reduce to a simmer, cover and cook for 17 minutes. Remove from heat, fluff with a fork and return cover to pot for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove bay leaves and put rice mixture into a mixing bowl. Gently mix in the beans, being careful not to break them. Season well with salt and pepper and transfer to a serving bowl. Serve hot.</li>
